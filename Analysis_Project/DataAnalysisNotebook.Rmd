This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

roster_2020_21 <- read_csv("wbb_rosters_2020_21.csv")
roster_2021_22 <- read_csv("wbb_rosters_2021_22.csv")
roster_2022_23 <- read_csv("wbb_rosters_2022_23.csv")
roster_2023_24 <- read_csv("wbb_rosters_2023_24.csv")
old_years_cleaned <- read_csv("years_cleaned.csv")
years_cleaned <- old_years_cleaned |>
  group_by(`year-clean`) |> 
  summarize(sum(count, na.rm = TRUE))

```

Note: Data was cleaned for us. You can see in the last couple columns of each of the roster data sets that they were cleaned for us by whoever modified the data then. The only real limitations of this data is that they do not provide data earlier than the 2020-21 season and they do not provide statistics for any of the teams. As for statistics, this is not an issue we are able to solve due to the problem of finding the data for every single player on any team including D2 or D3 teams. It looks like we will be able to effectively answer all of the questions that we listed before break.

Question 1: What states produce the most D1 women's basketball players?

```{r}
players_by_state_2020_21 <- roster_2020_21 |>
  group_by(state_clean) |>
  summarize(
    count_2020 = n()
  ) |>
  filter(state_clean != "NA")

players_by_state_2021_22 <- roster_2021_22 |>
  group_by(state_clean) |>
  summarize(
    count_2021 = n()
  ) |>
  filter(state_clean != "NA")

players_by_state_2022_23 <- roster_2022_23 |>
  group_by(state_clean) |>
  summarize(
    count_2022 = n()
  ) |>
  filter(state_clean != "NA", state_clean != "USVI")

players_by_state_2023_24 <- roster_2023_24 |>
  group_by(state_clean) |>
  summarize(
    count_2023 = n()
  ) |>
  filter(state_clean != "NA")

players_change_over_time <- players_by_state_2020_21 |>
  left_join(players_by_state_2021_22, by = "state_clean") |>
  left_join(players_by_state_2022_23, by = "state_clean") |>
  left_join(players_by_state_2023_24, by = "state_clean") |>
  mutate(total_players = count_2020 + count_2021 + count_2022 + count_2023) |>
  mutate(percentage_change = (count_2023 - count_2020)/count_2020*100) |>
  arrange(desc(total_players))

players_change_over_time
```

Note: Pennsylvania has the produced the most women's college basketball players over the last four years with Texas in second place.

Question 2: Which power 5 conferences have the tallest teams?

```{r}
roster_2023_24 |>
  filter(conference == 'Pac-12' | conference == 'SEC' | conference == 'Big 12' | conference == 'ACC' | conference == 'Big Ten') |>
  group_by(team) |>
  summarize(
    total_players = n(),
    total_height = sum(total_inches),
    mean_total_inches = total_height/total_players
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(mean_total_inches))
```

Notes: Texas is the tallest team in the power five with an average height of over 6'1". UCLA, Indiana, South Carolina, Michigan and Missouri are all not far behind. You can see that these teams have out-rebounded there opponents greatly by looking at rebounding margin on this link:

<https://www.ncaa.com/stats/basketball-women/d1/current/team/117>

**This is our most newsworthy finding right now**, showing a decent correlation between height and rebounding. Because there is no way to download the data online without a bunch of extensive work and external tools, I cannot perform a correlation test here but seeing many of the top teams in average height correspond with rebounding is certainly very convincing

**Question 3: What is the percentage of freshmen, sophomores, juniors, seniors, redshirts, and grad students per each team and how has it changed over time?**

```{r}
#create a dataframe with the team, year, and redshirt columns, then group by team and reshirts to find a count of each year

#mutate a total column as well as percent columns

#look at each year separately and potentially combine to see change over time
```

Notes:

**Question 4: What school took in the most transfers? What school had the most players transfer out?**

```{r}
#filter for only the players with something in the previous_school column

#create two different dataframes: one grouped by team and one grouped by previous_school

#potentially pull in external transfer data to create a more comprehensive list
```

Notes:

**Question 5: Which teams have the most in-state players?**

```{r}
#create a column that checks if the state column for the team and the state column for the player's home state match

#filter for only the players that had a match

#group by team and count
```
